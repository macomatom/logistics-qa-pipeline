## üß† Overview
This project presents an end-to-end Question Answering (QA) pipeline tailored for the logistics domain. It covers:

- Automatic generation of realistic shipment descriptions from structured JSON
- Synthetic QA pair creation using LLaMA 3.3
- Dataset formatting in SQuADv2-style JSON
- Fine-tuning and evaluation of three transformer-based models:
  - `XtremeDistil l12 h384 Uncased`
  - `XLM-RoBERTa Base`
  - `XLM-RoBERTa Large`

The system handles both **extractive** and **boolean (yes/no)** question types using a unified model architecture with a dual QA head.

## üìä Results

Evaluation on the synthetic dataset shows:

| Model               | F1 (Extractive) | F1 (Boolean) |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| XtremeDistil       | 83.4%           | 77.5%        |
| XLM-RoBERTa Base   | 93.5%           | 90.1%        |
| XLM-RoBERTa Large  | 95.5%           | 92.1%        |
